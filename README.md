### Why macshot?

- **Capture & annotate in one flow** — select a region, draw arrows/text/shapes/blur, copy to clipboard. One hotkey, zero friction.
- **Screen recording with built-in editor** — record any area or full screen as MP4/GIF with system audio + microphone. Audio merge dialog with per-track volume control. Trim and export without leaving the app.
- **Scroll capture** — select a region and scroll. macshot stitches it into one seamless tall (or wide) image automatically.
- **Upload anywhere** — one-click upload to Google Drive, imgbb, or any S3-compatible service (Cloudflare R2, AWS S3, MinIO, etc.). Link copied to clipboard instantly.
- **Lightweight & native** — lives in your menu bar. Built with Swift and AppKit, not a web browser in disguise.
- **40 languages** — English, 中文, 日本語, 한국어, Deutsch, Français, Español, Italiano, Português, العربية, हिन्दी, and 29 more. Auto-detects your system language.

- **Boundary snap** — selection edges snap to strong color edges (UI lines, window borders) while dragging or resizing; hold `Option` to bypass
- **Scroll capture** — auto-detects vertical or horizontal scrolling, stitches with Apple Vision, live preview panel beside the capture region
- **Capture delay** — 3/5/10/30 second countdown before capture, set via menu bar. Escape to cancel.

## Donations

Thanks for thinking about it, but macshot doesn't take donations. I make this in my free time and I'm happy to keep it that way, so there's no "buy me a coffee" or sponsorship link.

If you'd like to help out, starring the repo, reporting bugs, or contributing is more than enough. Thank you! 🙏
